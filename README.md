# Task-1 create VPC using Terraform and github actions


Workflow
Add Code to GitHub: Push your code changes to the GitHub repository.

Terraform Configuration: Use Terraform to set up a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) in AWS.

State File Management: Store the Terraform state file in an S3 bucket.

Pull Request Checks: Configure GitHub Actions to run checks on pull requests. This will ensure that any new changes are validated before merging into the main branch, helping to prevent unwanted or incorrect changes.
